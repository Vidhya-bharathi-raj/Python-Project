## [World Population Data Analysis using Python](https://github.com/VidhyabharathirajC/Python-Project)

In this project, I utilized the Jupyter Notebook, a popular data science tool, to conduct an analysis. The workflow included:

### Data Scraping:
Employed the **Beautiful Soup** library to extract data from a specified URL.

### Data Manipulation:
Used the **Pandas** library to clean and structure the data for analysis.

### Data Visualization:
Created insightful visualizations using Matplotlib, including:
- A **bar chart** showcasing the ‘Top 10 countries by population’.
